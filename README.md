Game Store Website
About the website
The proposed project is aimed at creating an online game-selling website that offers users a variety of features to enhance their gaming experience. Users can browse and choose their favorite games from a wide selection of options, add them to their shopping cart, and easily purchase and download them using various payment methods. Once users have downloaded a game, they can review and rate it to help other users make informed decisions. Users can also choose their favorite gaming platforms and select preferred game categories to quickly find games that match their preferences. In addition to these features, the website provides membership management options, including a joining feature for visitors, the ability to add friends and family members to a list and view their wish lists, and the option to register for events. Members can also share their wish lists through one social media network.
To ensure an optimal user experience, the system's objectives include a less than 2-second response time for all transactions, a forget password link that sends an email in under 1-minute, user-friendly error messages, and automatic saving of content when the window is unexpectedly turned off. The project's critical success factors include completing work on time, good communication among team members, and a clear understanding of the project's purpose and goal. The preliminary technical architecture of the system includes C#, the .NET Framework, and a Microsoft SQL database server. Overall, the proposed online game-selling website provides a comprehensive solution for gamers who want to easily find, purchase, and download their favorite games. With its user-friendly interface, robust feature set, and a wide selection of games, the website is poised to become a popular destination for gaming enthusiasts around the world. 

New Feature: 

As part of the ongoing development of the online game-selling website, a new feature has been added to offer users the option of hard copy delivery of their purchased games. This feature provides a convenient option for users who prefer physical copies of their games, and allows the website to reach a wider audience who may not have access to digital downloads or prefer physical copies. Users who select the hard copy delivery option will receive their purchased game in a timely and efficient manner, with tracking information provided for added convenience. This new feature is a valuable addition to the website's existing features and enhances the overall user experience by offering users more choices in how they receive their purchased games.
